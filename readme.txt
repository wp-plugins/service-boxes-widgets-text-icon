Service Boxes Widgets Text Icon will display Top, bottom, Left, Right for widget title.

== Description ==

Basically it just a WordPress "Service Boxes Text Widget" but with additional icon font selector based on <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">FontAwesome</a>. The Icon will display Top, bottom, Left, Right to widget title.
Font Awesome is my favorite of the free font icon sets.All of the 220 pixel perfect icons,have great cross-browser support and are easy to use. 
I wanted to be able to use the icons without having to rely on my current theme, so I created a simple WordPress widget Text plugin. 

Easy to configure CSS
